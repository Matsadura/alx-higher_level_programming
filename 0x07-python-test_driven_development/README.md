# 0x07-Python - Test-driven Development (TDD)

1. **Whatâ€™s an interactive test:**
   An interactive test in Python is a test that requires user interaction or input during execution. It can be used to test user interfaces, command-line interfaces, or interactive functionalities of a program.

2. **Why tests are important:**
   Tests are crucial in software development to ensure code correctness, maintainability, and reliability. They help identify bugs early, verify functionality, prevent regressions, and improve code quality.

3. **How to write Docstrings to create tests:**
   Docstrings in Python can be used to document functions, classes, and modules. By following a specific format (e.g., using `unittest` framework's `doctest` module), docstrings can also serve as tests by including executable code examples.

4. **How to write documentation for each module and function:**
   Writing documentation for modules and functions is important for code readability and maintainability. It typically involves using descriptive comments, docstrings, and following a consistent documentation style (e.g., reStructuredText or Markdown).

5. **What are the basic option flags to create tests:**
   In Python, you can create tests using various testing frameworks such as `unittest`, `pytest`, and `doctest`. Basic option flags for creating tests include:
   - `-v` or `--verbose`: Display detailed test output.
   - `-k EXPRESSION`: Run tests matching the given expression.
   - `-x` or `--exitfirst`: Stop testing after the first failure or error.
   - `-m MARKEXPR`: Run tests marked with the specified marker expression.

6. **How to find edge cases:**
   Edge cases are scenarios where the behavior of a program may differ from typical cases. To find edge cases, consider boundary conditions, extreme inputs, invalid inputs, empty inputs, and scenarios that might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
