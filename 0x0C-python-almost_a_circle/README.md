# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

1. **What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project:**
   Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units (functions, methods, classes) are tested in isolation to ensure they work correctly. In a large project, you can implement unit testing using testing frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest`. Write test cases for each unit to verify its behavior.

2. **How to serialize and deserialize a Class:**
   Serialization is the process of converting a class instance into a format suitable for storage or transmission. Deserialization is the reverse process. You can use the `pickle` module for serialization and deserialization in Python:
   ```python
   import pickle

   # Serialize
   with open('object.pickle', 'wb') as file:
       pickle.dump(object_instance, file)

   # Deserialize
   with open('object.pickle', 'rb') as file:
       object_instance = pickle.load(file)
   ```

3. **How to write and read a JSON file:**
   Use the `json` module for working with JSON files:
   ```python
   import json

   # Write JSON
   with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
       json.dump(data, file)

   # Read JSON
   with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
       data = json.load(file)
   ```

4. **What is *args and how to use it:**
   `*args` is used in function definitions to pass a variable number of positional arguments. It collects extra positional arguments as a tuple. For example:
   ```python
   def my_function(*args):
       for arg in args:
           print(arg)

   my_function(1, 2, 3)  # Output: 1 2 3
   ```

5. **What is **kwargs and how to use it:**
   `**kwargs` is used in function definitions to pass a variable number of keyword arguments. It collects extra keyword arguments as a dictionary. For example:
   ```python
   def my_function(**kwargs):
       for key, value in kwargs.items():
           print(f'{key}: {value}')

   my_function(name='John', age=30)  # Output: name: John, age: 30
   ```

6. **How to handle named arguments in a function:**
   Named arguments are handled automatically in Python functions. You can define function parameters with default values to handle optional arguments:
   ```python
   def greet(name='Guest'):
       print(f'Hello, {name}!')

   greet()  # Output: Hello, Guest!
   greet('John')  # Output: Hello, John!
   ```
